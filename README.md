### Data Science | Frontend Development | Researcher | Digital Design Enthusiast | PhD Aspirant

Hi, I’m **Livia**, a Data Science Master’s student at Sapienza University of Rome. My interests span from frontend development and digital illustrations to research on health and behavioral science. I'm passionate about using data-driven approaches and creative design to solve complex real-world problems, especially those related to human behavior, health promotion, and technology.

## 💻 **Tech Interests and Projects**

- **Frontend Development**: 
  I’ve been exploring frontend development through beginner-level projects focused on **animations** and smaller interface designs. You can check out these projects [here](https://github.com/stars/Livia020799/lists/frontend-animation). While they are not full web applications, they’ve allowed me to practice key skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Digital Illustration and Design**: 
  In addition to my technical projects, I’m passionate about **digital illustrations and design**. I’ve created several design projects and websites, which I showcase on my [personal website](https://livia263.webnode.it/). You can also see more of my work on my Instagram profile [@wakai.design](https://www.instagram.com/wakai.design?igsh=MW1nZGF6ZnN5OWgwdg==).

- **Research**:
  I am currently involved in the **DE-PASS Best Evidence Statement (BESt)** project, which is part of the research initiative [DE-PASS](https://depass.eu/). This project focuses on identifying modifiable determinants of physical activity and sedentary behavior in older adults aged over 65. The goal is to create a multidisciplinary network of stakeholders to better understand these determinants and translate this knowledge into actionable, user-friendly tools that help policy makers promote healthier environments.

- **CyberHack4AI**:
  My team and I secured **2nd place** at the **CyberHack4AI hackathon**, held at Sapienza University of Rome in October 2024. Our project, **StudentBridge**, is an AI-powered platform designed to support international students moving to Rome by providing centralized information on housing, legal documentation, and university processes. You can check out the full project [here](https://github.com/Livia020799/Cyberhack4AI_2024).

## 🙌 **More About Me**

- 🥋 I'm a **brown belt** in judo, which I’ve practiced as of October 2024 for 10 years. Judo has instilled in me resilience, discipline, and a constant drive for improvement—qualities that I apply to both my academic and professional pursuits.

- 🎹🎻 Music has been a key part of my life. I’ve been playing the **piano since I was 8**, and I also played the **violin** during middle school. This blend of technical and creative outlets helps me balance my logical side with artistic expression.

## 🔍 **Current Focus**

I am currently pursuing an **MSc in Data Science** at Sapienza University of Rome, where I am exploring areas such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and Bayesian analysis. My goal is to apply these skills in diverse fields, from public health to technology, with a focus on meaningful impact.

I am also passionate about the **Hikikomori phenomenon**, which I researched during my Bachelor's thesis. I aspire to continue this work and pursue a **PhD in Japan**, where I can delve deeper into this sociocultural issue.
